Rise up this mornin
Smiled with the risin sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singin sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying: This is my message to you

Dont worry about a thing
Cause every little thing gonna be all right
Dont worry about a thing
Cause every little thing gonna be all right
